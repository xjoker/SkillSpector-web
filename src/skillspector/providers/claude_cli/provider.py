"""Claude CLI provider — Stage-2 LLM analysis via the local ``claude`` binary.

Activated by ``SKILLSPECTOR_PROVIDER=claude_cli``. Authentication is handled by
the ``claude`` CLI's own OAuth/keychain session (``claude auth login``); no API
key is read or required.

All behaviour is inherited from
:class:`skillspector.providers._agent_cli_base.AgentCLIProviderBase`; the
"claude"-specific argv, output parsing, and auth probe live in the
:mod:`skillspector.providers._agent_cli` registry. Security comes from the
hardened, fail-closed ``run_agent_cli`` chokepoint.
