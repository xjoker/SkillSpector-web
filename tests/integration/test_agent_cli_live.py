"""Optional *live* integration tests for the agent-CLI providers.

WHY THESE ARE OPTIONAL
----------------------
These tests invoke the REAL local agent CLIs (``claude`` / ``codex`` /
``gemini``), so they are marked ``integration`` and are therefore EXCLUDED from
the default test run — ``pyproject.toml`` sets ``addopts = -m 'not
integration'``. A developer (at NVIDIA or anywhere) who does **not** have any of
these CLIs installed can run the full unit suite — ``make test-unit`` /
``pytest`` — with zero CLI dependency: nothing here is even collected, and the
provider logic is fully covered by the mocked unit tests in
``tests/unit/test_agent_cli.py`` and ``tests/unit/test_providers.py``.

When you DO opt in with ``-m integration``, each case additionally SKIPS
per-CLI when that binary is absent or unauthenticated. So if you only have
``codex`` installed, the codex cases run and the claude/gemini cases skip
cleanly — a missing tool never fails the suite.

    # exercise whichever agent CLIs you happen to have installed + logged in:
    uv run pytest -m integration tests/integration/test_agent_cli_live.py -v

Each case verifies, against the real binary:
  1. A call returns non-empty text with NO model pinned — ``model=""`` means the
     CLI uses the user's OWN default model (``--model`` is omitted).
  2. A prompt containing a prompt-injection is returned as analysis *text*, not
     executed (the capability-stripped, fail-closed invocation; the flags that
     guarantee this are unit-tested in ``tests/unit/test_agent_cli.py``).

``agy`` (Antigravity) is intentionally NOT covered: it is registered but
DISABLED — its print mode renders to a TTY and returns nothing on a pipe, so it
cannot be driven programmatically (see the note in
``skillspector.providers._agent_cli``). Its fail-closed behaviour is asserted by
the unit tests, which need no binary.
